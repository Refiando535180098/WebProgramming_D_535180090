        <figcaption>In 2017 France reached a total of 13,759 MW installed wind power capacity placing France at that time as the world's eighth
            largest wind power nation by installed capacity, behind the United Kingdom and Canada and ahead of Italy and Brazil. According to the
            IEA the yearly wind production was 20.2 TWh in 2015, representing almost 23% of the 88.4 TWh from renewable sources in France during that year.
            Furthermore wind provided for 4.3% of the countryâ€™s electricity demand out of the 18.7% provided by renewables in 2015.</figcaption>
